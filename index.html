<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
	I am currently unemployed looking for entry level positions. I have learned a lot of skills with computers, networks, electronics, and operating heavy equipment. 
	<br/>
	I repair electronics, and I fix electrical problems with AC and DC currents. I love playing with electricity. I have a 1000RMS surround sound. Everyone who knows me comes to me for help with unlocking iphones(jail-breaking), replacing parts like the screen, fixing sound issues, rather it be inside hooking up home entertainment systems or upgrading the entire sound system of their car.
	<br/>
	I've taken my schooling and set up my own home network; also with that I can build computers, install any operating system need be, set up a network, and maintain it to an extent. I have basic hacking and coding skills. My google search skills have taught me alot as well. I am very resourceful with it, along with what I already know how to do. I don't rely on it, it is just a back up.
	<br/>
	I have two classes left for an Associates degree in AAS NSA and Information Technology. I am returning to school since i moved here from Indiana. I am very knowledgeable in administration and installing UNIX, MAC OS X, and Microsoft operating systems as well as upgrading and installing software. I am currently trying to reinstall OS X on my dell 435mt, but i think i need to upgrade GPU. I am also proficient in IP addressing and sub-netting along with the ability to install a network infrastructure and maintain it.
